# ids-automation-example

This package demonstrates how to use WALKOFF as a Security Orchestration, Automation, Response (SOAR) capability with
other open source tools like Bro, ElasticSearch, Kibana, TheHive, Cortex, etc.

Deploy with `docker stack deploy simpleids` (it may take some time to converge due to Kibana startup time).
